# OpenVPN搭建

## 基本服务端配置文件
```
local 192.168.0.2        # 监听本地接口192.168.0.2
port 1194                       # 端口1194
proto udp                      # 使用 UDP。TCP会有严重的性能问题。
dev tap                           # 将以太网二层报文装入DTLS会话。
ca /etc/ca.crt                # CA证书
cert /etc/server.crt   # 证书
key /etc/server.key.txt  # 私钥
dh /etc/dh.pem          # Deffie Hellman参数
auth SHA512               # 使用SHA512认证，不然默认SHA1。
server 192.168.199.0 255.255.255.0   # 分配网段192.168.199.0/24
push "dhcp-option DNS 192.168.199.1"       # 向客户端推送DNS服务器IP
client-to-client             # 允许客户端之间互通
keepalive 10 120         # 保持连接
tls-crypt-v2 /etc/server.key.txt # 使用该密钥提供控制平面的额外加密
```

## 证书
注：这是在Windows运行和Linux下有指令上的区别
```shell
# 初始化证书
#会在当前目录创建kpi文件夹
./easyrsa init-pki 

#生成ca证书
./easyrsa build-ca nopass

#生成服务端证书
./easyrsa build-server-full server nopass

#生成客户端证书
./easyrsa build-client-full client nopass

#生成DH密钥交换协议
./easyrsa gen-dh
```

## 修改服务端配置文件
```
复制server.ovpn文件至C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config目录,修改如下选项:
a)端口:(公网需要对应开通此端口)port udp 1194
b)协议文件名:dh dh2048.pem修改为dh dh.pem
c)运行多用户使用同一客户端证书:;duplicate-cn取消注释(前面;号删除)修改为duplicate-cn
d)注释掉此行(前面加#号): tls-auth ta.key 0修改为#tls-auth ta.key 0


将服务证书,服务key,ca证书,dh文件复制到文件夹C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config下
```

## 客户端配置文件
```
1.配置客户端文件
客户端配置文件client.ovpn,模板在C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\sample-config,复制该文件
到C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config目录下,修改客户端配置如下:
a)修改连接服务器地址: remote my-server-1 1194修改为remote 服务器公网ip 1194
b)注释掉此行(前面加#号): tls-auth ta.key 1修改为# tls-auth ta.key 1


生成的客户端证书和配置文件,客户端需要的一共有5个文件:ca.crt、client.crt、client.key、
ta.key(如果不开启tls-auth,则无需该文件)、client.ovpn。为了避免文件太多,管理不便!需要
将客户端证书合并到配置文件中。具体方法如下。
注：如果要使用，注释掉配置文件中ca，cert，key等
<ca>
ca.crt文件内容
</ca>
<cert>
client.crt文件内容
</cert>
<key>
client.key文件内容
</key>
key-direction 1
<tls-auth>
ta.key文件内容
</tls-auth>
```

## 其他相关配置
### 配置静态代理
```shell
# 修改服务端配置文件
# 注释掉服务端配置文件，正常退出会在ipp.txt文件出现数据
ifconfig-pool-persist ipp.txt
```

### 指定代理
```shell
route 192.168.1.0 255.255.0.0 net_gateway #不走代理
route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 vpn_gateway #走代理

route-nopull #如果加这一行任何代理都不会走
```

### 配置开机自启
```shell
# 注：--cd命令
/usr/sbin/openvpn --cd /etc/openvpn/server/ --config /etc/openvpn/server/server.ovpn
```

### 使用TCP报错
```shell
# 服务端这个配置文件注释掉
explicit-exit-notify 1
```

# Configure server mode for ethernet bridging.
# You must first use your OS's bridging capability
# to bridge the TAP interface with the ethernet
# NIC interface.  Then you must manually set the
# IP/netmask on the bridge interface, here we
# assume 10.8.0.4/255.255.255.0.  Finally we
# must set aside an IP range in this subnet
# (start=10.8.0.50 end=10.8.0.100) to allocate
# to connecting clients.  Leave this line commented
# out unless you are ethernet bridging.
;server-bridge 10.8.0.4 255.255.255.0 10.8.0.50 10.8.0.100

# Configure server mode for ethernet bridging
# using a DHCP-proxy, where clients talk
# to the OpenVPN server-side DHCP server
# to receive their IP address allocation
# and DNS server addresses.  You must first use
# your OS's bridging capability to bridge the TAP
# interface with the ethernet NIC interface.
# Note: this mode only works on clients (such as
# Windows), where the client-side TAP adapter is
# bound to a DHCP client.
;server-bridge

# Push routes to the client to allow it
# to reach other private subnets behind
# the server.  Remember that these
# private subnets will also need
# to know to route the OpenVPN client
# address pool (10.8.0.0/255.255.255.0)
# back to the OpenVPN server.
;push "route 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0"
;push "route 192.168.20.0 255.255.255.0"

# To assign specific IP addresses to specific
# clients or if a connecting client has a private
# subnet behind it that should also have VPN access,
# use the subdirectory "ccd" for client-specific
# configuration files (see man page for more info).

# EXAMPLE: Suppose the client
# having the certificate common name "Thelonious"
# also has a small subnet behind his connecting
# machine, such as 192.168.40.128/255.255.255.248.
# First, uncomment out these lines:
;client-config-dir ccd
;route 192.168.40.128 255.255.255.248
# Then create a file ccd/Thelonious with this line:
#   iroute 192.168.40.128 255.255.255.248
# This will allow Thelonious' private subnet to
# access the VPN.  This example will only work
# if you are routing, not bridging, i.e. you are
# using "dev tun" and "server" directives.

# EXAMPLE: Suppose you want to give
# Thelonious a fixed VPN IP address of 10.9.0.1.
# First uncomment out these lines:
;client-config-dir ccd
;route 10.9.0.0 255.255.255.252
# Then add this line to ccd/Thelonious:
#   ifconfig-push 10.9.0.1 10.9.0.2

# Suppose that you want to enable different
# firewall access policies for different groups
# of clients.  There are two methods:
# (1) Run multiple OpenVPN daemons, one for each
#     group, and firewall the TUN/TAP interface
#     for each group/daemon appropriately.
# (2) (Advanced) Create a script to dynamically
#     modify the firewall in response to access
#     from different clients.  See man
#     page for more info on learn-address script.
;learn-address ./script

# If enabled, this directive will configure
# all clients to redirect their default
# network gateway through the VPN, causing
# all IP traffic such as web browsing and
# and DNS lookups to go through the VPN
# (The OpenVPN server machine may need to NAT
# or bridge the TUN/TAP interface to the internet
# in order for this to work properly).
;push "redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp"

# Certain Windows-specific network settings
# can be pushed to clients, such as DNS
# or WINS server addresses.  CAVEAT:
# http://openvpn.net/faq.html#dhcpcaveats
# The addresses below refer to the public
# DNS servers provided by opendns.com.
;push "dhcp-option DNS 208.67.222.222"
;push "dhcp-option DNS 208.67.220.220"

# Uncomment this directive to allow different
# clients to be able to "see" each other.
# By default, clients will only see the server.
# To force clients to only see the server, you
# will also need to appropriately firewall the
# server's TUN/TAP interface.
;client-to-client

# Uncomment this directive if multiple clients
# might connect with the same certificate/key
# files or common names.  This is recommended
# only for testing purposes.  For production use,
# each client should have its own certificate/key
# pair.
#
# IF YOU HAVE NOT GENERATED INDIVIDUAL
# CERTIFICATE/KEY PAIRS FOR EACH CLIENT,
# EACH HAVING ITS OWN UNIQUE "COMMON NAME",
# UNCOMMENT THIS LINE OUT.

# The keepalive directive causes ping-like
# messages to be sent back and forth over

# a 120 second time period.
